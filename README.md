# Introduction to JavaScript

Javascript is:

- Interpreted:
    - An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language.

- Just-in-time:
    - In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation is compilation (of computer code) during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.

- Dynamic: 
    - Where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.

- Single threated:
    - Thread in computer science is the execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the same time. Each unit capable of executing code is called a thread.
- Multi-paradigm:
    - Multiple approaches to solve a given problem
- First-class-function :
    - A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

- Supporting Object Oriented:
    - JavaScript is a Prototype-based programming paradigm.
        But it has support for it. It has the class keyword, which is just a syntactic sugar over prototypes. We actually create prototypes in javascript, and not classes. The class keyword is there to make javascript look like an OOP language.
    - Syntactic sugar is a term for a more concise syntax that provides the same functionality for something that already exists. It aims to help make code shorter, therefore, easier to write. No new functionality is introduced.

- Imperative 
    - How the programme execute.
- Declarative
    - What programme to be executed.
